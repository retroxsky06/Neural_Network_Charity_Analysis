# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview

### Software & Resources
- Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas
- Data: [charity_data.csv]()

## Results

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
do a overview of the preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
overview of CPE
-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Attempt 1: increased to 80, 60
Attempt 2: added an extra layer = did not work, decreased
Attempt 3: change function to tanh

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
